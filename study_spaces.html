                <li><a href="https://www.lib.umich.edu/locations-and-hours/shapiro-library"><strong>Shapiro Library:</strong></a>
                    The Shapiro Undergraduate Library, also known as the Ugli, is a prime location to meet for a group project, find a study nook, or pull a cram session — fueled with food and drink from the first-floor café, or better known as the Mujo Café. It has 4 floors of studying area, with every floor hosting their own unique features, including but not limited to design labs, CAEN computer labs, sound and musical technical studios, interactive study rooms, and more! An unspoken rule is the higher up you go, the quieter you are, making the 4th floor a perfect study option if you need to lock in and focus.

                    <a href="https://uunions.umich.edu/union/"><strong>Michigan Union:</strong></a>
                    The Michigan Union is one of the most beloved buildings on Central Campus. Impressive in stature and alive with activity, enter the Michigan Union and you’ll find yourself immediately immersed in the Go Blue! culture. The Michigan Union houses study and meeting spaces, six eateries, shops and student services. Their cafes are full of study tables and outlets to encourage students studying. And it’s home to the IdeaHub for student organizations, run by the Center for Campus Involvement, which is a personal favorite of students to study. While you’re here, be sure to stroll through the historic halls, enjoy the beautifully restored architectural details and imagine all the Wolverines who have come through the doors.

                    Similar to the Michigan Union, the Michigan League is another beautiful student union located more on the north end of campus. Also home to student cafes and historic architecture, including brilliant stained glass windows, it is also home to the charming student-run Inn which offers comfortable accomodations for visitors. Many students stop in between classes or to grab a bite at Maizie’s Kitchen & Market. Additionally, during warmer weather, the famous fountain out front, Sunday Morning in Deep Waters, is sure to shine in front of the spectacular courtyard garden.

                    <a href="https://www.lib.umich.edu/visit-and-study/study-spaces/quiet-study-spaces/hatcher-south-carrels"><strong>Harlan Hatcher Library -- Study Carrels:</strong></a>
                    The Harlan Graduate Library is a perfect spot to study, complete with many floors of study space and quiet areas. However, the south section, in particular, has secluded spaces where you can focus privately. There are individual study carrels on almost every floor, which are small private cubby rooms for one person to study, complete with a desk, outlet, and window. There are open rooms on the fourth and fifth floors and reservable rooms on the third floor, and also larger study tables scattered across the floors for variety. Due to these carrels, Hatcher is most likely the quietest area you could be on campus to study, which is perfect before exam season. And for those that are interested in literature, the Hatcher Library has an amazing, extensive curated collection of books and research!
